# PureSight - Demo Presentation Script

## 🎯 Opening (30 seconds)

"Good [morning/afternoon], I'm Kartik Garg, and I'm here to present **PureSight** - an AI-powered solution that helps consumers make informed decisions about the products they buy.

Did you know that 52.5% of consumers never read product labels because they assume everything in stores is safe? And even the 47.5% who do read them struggle with complex scientific terminology.

PureSight solves this problem using artificial intelligence to scan, analyze, and explain product ingredients in seconds."

## 📊 Problem Statement (1 minute)

**[Show slide 2 from your PPT]**

"Let me break down the problem we're solving:

1. **Information Gap:** Most consumers cannot understand complex ingredient labels
   - Scientific names are confusing
   - Harmful substances are disguised with technical terms
   
2. **Time Consuming:** Manual research on each ingredient takes hours
   - Multiple sources needed
   - Conflicting information
   
3. **No Quick Solution:** There's no reliable way to assess product safety instantly
   - People rely on brand reputation
   - Marketing claims can be misleading
   
4. **Health & Environmental Risks:** This leads to uninformed purchasing decisions
   - Exposure to harmful chemicals
   - Long-term health impacts"
